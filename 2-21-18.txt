Started work on the final major python project: Signal Analysis.
I remember doing this project about a year ago in C++, and looking 
through my old code I kind of feel like im trolling my self because
although I comented that c++ version of the project I only did the bare 
minimum. 
The major obstacles that im facing are the specific formulas I have to 
extrapolate from the data files, some of which were not only confusing in
the instructions but also in their coded implimentation. 

By no means is it a major issue, just something I need to research the 
specifics of.
