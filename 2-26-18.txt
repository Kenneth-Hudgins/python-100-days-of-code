Made great progress on the Signal Analysis project. Finished the conversion
of both files from scientific notation to decimals functions, as well as the
mean and variance for both functions. The only thing stopping me from 
finishing it tonight is that I have stuff I need to get up early for 
tomorrow.

Had an initial problem with how to properly indent code in functions and
finding the correct formulas for the requested calculations; but I think at
this point I have it down.
