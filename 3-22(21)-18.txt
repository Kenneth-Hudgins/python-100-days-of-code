Just finished the codezinger number converter part 2 problem and
I have been working on for a large part of the day.
I attempted it 3 seperate times each from the ground up and my final version is
surely way more complicated than it could be.

I passed all but 3 of the test cases:

-1 was due to timeout which doesnt happen on my laptop since its not a server trying to optimize runtimes 
and prevent an infinite loop.The code produces the requested answer on my machine.

-The other 2 failures are due to the requesting wanting the numbers in "lakh" which I beleive is a form of
indian currency. By our system of measurement my produced answers would be correct.
